The goal of testgrad is to take the frontend from tinygrad and render pure C that runs it.

codegen and engine won't be copied over

The tensor, UOp, graph rewrite, and rendering infra is good.

== takeaways to date ==

* symbolic should move from codegen to uop. uop should not import from codegen (done)
* "tinygrad" is hardcoded in device.py when it searches for ops
* remove CPU graph
* split libc import line

* switch from ASSIGN -> STORE everywhere. delete ASSIGN
* switch order of inputs to BUFFER, should be DEVICE then (optional) unique
* replace get_kernel with get_program returning ProgramSpec. move Kernel class stuff here
* move linearizer type_verify into codegen/__init__
