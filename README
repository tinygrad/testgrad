The goal of testgrad is to take the frontend from tinygrad and render pure C that runs it.

codegen and engine won't be copied over

The tensor, UOp, graph rewrite, and rendering infra is good.

== takeaways to date ==

* symbolic should move from codegen to uop. uop should not import from codegen (done)
* "tinygrad" is hardcoded in device.py when it searches for ops
