The goal of testgrad is to take the frontend from tinygrad and render pure C that runs it.

codegen and engine won't be copied over

The tensor, UOp, graph rewrite, and rendering infra is good.

== takeaways to date ==

* symbolic should move from codegen to uop. uop should not import from codegen (done)
* replace get_kernel with get_program returning ProgramSpec. move Kernel class stuff here (done)
* move linearizer type_verify into codegen/__init__ (done)
* "tinygrad" is hardcoded in device.py when it searches for ops (fixed)
* split libc import line (done)
* remove CPU graph (done)

* switch from ASSIGN -> STORE everywhere. delete ASSIGN
* support copyin/copyout on buffer view? should buffer view be a shape?
* fix the const view shape
